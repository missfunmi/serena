**Serena** is an adaptive coach for athletes that dynamically adjusts your training sessions based on your daily recovery metrics.

It pulls workouts from your preferred training platform (such as Training Peaks) and syncs with your wearable device (Oura, Whoop, etc.) to intelligently scale your workouts to your body's readiness.
